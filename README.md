[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/your-netlify-badge-id/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/easy2ride/deploys)  
Live Demo: https://easy2ride.netlify.app

Easy2Ride is a full-stack vehicle-rental web app built with React on the frontend and Firebase on the backend. Users can browse, book, pay (via Razorpay), and manage scooter/motorbike rentals. Confirmation and cancellation emails are sent via EmailJS, and booking receipts can be downloaded as beautifully formatted PDFs.

*Currently the Razorpay api is working in test mode, so it does not involve real transactions. Feel free to try the complete booking processðŸ™ƒ!
